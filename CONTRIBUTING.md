## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree that your work will be
licensed under the license used by the project.

If you have any large pull request in mind (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, etc), **please ask first** otherwise you risk spending
a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might
not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions in the project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and don't forget to add your own tests and
documentation. When working with git, we recommend the following process
in order to craft an excellent pull request:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/business_doer
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd business_doer
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mbramson/business_doer
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off of `master`) to contain your feature, change,
   or fix.

   **IMPORTANT**: Making changes in `master` is discouraged. You should always
   keep your local `master` in sync with upstream `master` and make your
   changes in topic branches.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Keep your commit messages organized,
   with a short description in the first line and more detailed information on
   the following lines. Feel free to use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Make sure all the tests are still passing.

   ```bash
   mix test
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

8. If you haven't updated your pull request for a while, you should consider
   rebasing on master and resolving any conflicts.

   **IMPORTANT**: _Never ever_ merge upstream `master` into your branches. You
   should always `git rebase` on `master` to bring your changes up to date when
   necessary.

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   git checkout <your-topic-branch>
   git rebase master
   ```

Thank you for your contributions!
